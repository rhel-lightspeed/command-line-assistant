# Contributing to Command Line Assistant

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Command Line Assistant
codebase, which are hosted in the [RHEL Lightspeed
Organization](https://github.com/rhel-lightspeed) on GitHub. These are mostly
guidelines, not rules.

## What should I know before I get started?

Below are a list of things to keep in mind when developing and submitting
contributions to this repository.

1. All Python code must be compatible with versions 3.9+.
2. The code should follow linting from ruff.
3. All commits should have passed the pre-commit checks.
4. Don't change code that is not related to your issue/ticket, open a new
   issue/ticket if that's the case.

### Working with GitHub

If you are not sure on how GitHub works, you can read the quickstart guide from
GitHub to introduce you on how to get started at the platform. [GitHub
Quickstart - Hello
World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

### Setting up Git

If you never used `git` before, GitHub has a nice quickstart on how to set it
up and get things ready. [GitHub Quickstart - Set up
Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

### Forking a repository

Forking is necessary if you want to contribute with Command Line Assistant, but
if you are unsure on how this work (Or what a fork is), head out to this
quickstart guide from GitHub. [GitHub Quickstart - Fork a
repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

As an additional material, check out this Red Hat blog post about [What is an
open source
upstream?](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-open-source-upstream)

### Collaborating with Pull Requests

Check out this guide from GitHub on how to collaborate with pull requests. This
is an in-depth guide on everything you need to know about PRs, forks,
contributions and much more. [GitHub - Collaborating with pull
requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started with development

### Setting up the environment

The commands below will create a python3 virtual environment with all the
necessary dependencies installed. This is done via
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). If you don't have `poetry`
installed, the command below will take care of it for you.

Required packages:
- Python 3.9 or greater
- pip

Before installing the dependencies with `poetry`, make sure to follow the
installation instructions from
[PyGObject](https://pygobject.gnome.org/getting_started.html#fedora-logo-fedora).
This is required for running `clad`, and installing the rest of the
dependencies.

```sh
make install
```

### Update config to your needs

The project root contains a [basic configuration](./config.toml) file that
captures a set of options for Command Line Assistant. You can use it the way it
is, or, if needed, can update to your needs.

```toml
[output]
# otherwise recording via script session will be enforced
enforce_script = false
# file with output(s) of regular commands (e.g. ls, echo, etc.)
file = "/tmp/command-line-assistant_output.txt"
# Keep non-empty if your file contains only output of commands (not prompt itself)
prompt_separator = "$"

[history]
enabled = true
file = "~/.local/share/command-line-assistant/command-line-assistant_history.json"

[backend]
endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"

[backend.auth]
cert_file = "data/development/certificate/fake-certificate.pem"
key_file = "data/development/certificate/fake-key.pem"
verify_ssl = false

[logging]
level = "DEBUG"
```

### Asking questions through Command Line Assistant

```sh
c "How to uninstall RHEL?"

# OR with stdin

echo "How to uninstall RHEL?" | c
echo "How to uninstall RHEL?" | c "Text that will be appended to the stdin"

# Usage of caret '^'
# Takes last command output as query context (must be available from output_file value in config)
c "How to uninstall RHEL? ^"
#
# The query then is in following format:
# 2024-09-11 14:27:01,667 - INFO - Query:
# Context data: context text from file specified in config
# Question: How to uninstall RHEL?
```

### How to capture cmd output for usage of `^`

1. Use `script` tool and it's session
2. Use `tee` command to simply save output of command to some file
3. Use `tmux` workaround below

#### `tmux` workaround to capture output of every command

Please note that this is up to the user to decide if this is the best way to capture output of every command including
potential sensitive data.

Install `tmux` and put the following code in your `~/.bashrc`. It will invoke `tmux`, capturing the output of the
previous command and store it in a temporary file for `Command Line Assistant` to use. (Desclaimer: I didn't test it with other shells
other than `bash`.)

``` bash
# Set the PROMPT_COMMAND to capture the output after each command
SHELL_OUTPUT="$/tmp/command-line-assistant_output.tmp"
SHELL_OUTPUT_CLEANED="/tmp/command-line-assistant/command-line-assistant_output_cleaned.tmp"
# Function to capture the pane's output
function capture_pane_output() {
    tmux capture-pane -p > "$SHELL_OUTPUT"
    grep -v '^$' ${SHELL_OUTPUT} > ${SHELL_OUTPUT_CLEANED}
    rm -f ${SHELL_OUTPUT}
}
PROMPT_COMMAND="capture_pane_output"
```

If you get `ImportError: urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with LibreSSL
2.8.3`, try this:

```sh
pip uninstall urllib3
pip install 'urllib3<2.0'
```

All temporary files created during the usage (context, code blocks, command call output, captured shell output) are
stored in `/tmp/command-line-assistant/*`
